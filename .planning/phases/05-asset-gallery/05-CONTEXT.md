# Phase 5: Asset Gallery - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-13
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A browse-and-export hub where you can see all generated images across campaigns and quickly get them out to ad platforms. Think of it as the "output" side of the asset factory — you've generated 50+ variations, now you need to browse them, find the ones you want, and export them in the right format for Google Ads, Meta, TikTok, etc.

The gallery should feel organized like Figma — assets grouped by campaign or product in clear sections/frames, not just a wall of images. You can see everything at a glance, drill into specific campaigns, and grab what you need.

Platform-specific bundles are key: select assets and export a package that's already sized and formatted correctly for each ad platform. No manual resizing or format conversion.

## What Must Be Nailed

All three are equally critical for this phase to succeed:

- **Visual browsing** — Quickly see and find the right assets across campaigns
- **Filtering & search** — Find specific assets by campaign, product, goal, variation type
- **Export workflow** — Getting assets out in the right format with platform-specific bundles

## What's Out of Scope

Scope kept open for now; will be refined during planning.

## Specific Ideas

- Figma-style canvas organization: assets grouped in frames/sections by campaign or product
- Platform-specific export bundles (Google Ads, Meta, TikTok) with correct dimensions/formats
- Visual-first browsing, not a data table

## Additional Context

This phase connects the prompt generation (Phase 4) output to actual ad platform usage. The prompts generated earlier will be used to create images (likely Imagen 3), and this gallery is where those generated images live and get exported.

The "asset factory" vision from the original project — generating 500+ variations — means this gallery needs to handle volume while still being navigable. Figma-style organization helps manage scale.
