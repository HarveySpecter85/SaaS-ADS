# Phase 7: Conversational Ads - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-13
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Chat-first landing pages where visitors engage with an embedded chat to discover the right products. Instead of browsing static content and filling out forms, visitors have a conversation that helps them find what they need.

Think product discovery chat: the AI asks questions about what the visitor is looking for, understands their needs, and suggests relevant products based on the conversation. It feels like talking to a knowledgeable sales assistant, not filling out a lead form.

The chat appears as a widget — floating chat bubble in the corner, Intercom-style. Click to expand, have a conversation, get recommendations.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Smart recommendations** — The chat asks the right questions and suggests relevant products based on the visitor's answers. This is the core value: turning conversation into discovery.

The chat needs to understand the product catalog and make intelligent recommendations, not just keyword matching or generic responses.

## What's Out of Scope

No explicit exclusions specified — scope to be determined during planning based on what makes sense for the implementation.

## Specific Ideas

- Widget-style chat UI (floating bubble, expands on click, like Intercom)
- Chat should know products from the existing catalog (Phase 3 product data)
- Conversational flow that leads to product recommendations
- Brand-aware: uses brand tone/voice from ingested guidelines

</specifics>

## Additional Context

This phase connects to existing work:
- Brand data (Phase 2) for tone/voice
- Product catalog (Phase 3) for recommendations
- Campaign context (Phase 4) for relevant creative angles

The emphasis is on smart product discovery — the AI should feel helpful and knowledgeable, guiding visitors to the right products through natural conversation.
