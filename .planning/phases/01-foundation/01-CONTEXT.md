# Phase 1: Foundation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-13
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When you open AdOrchestrator, you land on a clean dashboard shell with a fixed left sidebar. It should feel like a professional internal tool from day 1 — think Linear's aesthetic: clean, fast, modern SaaS feel.

The sidebar will have icons/labels for each major section (Nano Banana, Gemini Core, etc.), even if those sections aren't built yet. The layout structure is set up to hold all the modules that come later without needing a redesign.

Team members log in with email/password and stay logged in. No friction, just get to work.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Layout ready for all modules** - The sidebar structure and content areas need to accommodate Nano Banana, Gemini Core, Gemini Nano, and Campaign Dashboard without redesign
- **Feels like a real product** - Linear-style aesthetic: clean, keyboard-friendly, modern SaaS look
- **Auth that works** - Simple email/password login, team members stay logged in

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- Multi-client management - Client switching comes later, just one context for now
- Dark mode / theming - Stick with one color scheme, don't build a theme system yet
- Complex permissions - Everyone on the team has same access, no roles yet
- Actual feature modules - Just the shell, not the content

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Linear-style aesthetic: clean, fast, keyboard-friendly
- Fixed left sidebar navigation with icons and labels
- Professional look from day 1 — not a prototype feel
- Sidebar sections stubbed out for future modules (Nano Banana, Gemini Core, etc.)

</specifics>

## Additional Context

This is an internal agency tool, so auth doesn't need to be complex — just the team needs access. The focus is on having a solid foundation that can grow with the product.

The sidebar navigation pattern was chosen over top nav to better accommodate the multiple modules (asset factory, strategic brain, tracking, dashboard) that will be built.
