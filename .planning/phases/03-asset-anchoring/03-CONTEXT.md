# Phase 3: Asset Anchoring - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-13
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Build a reference image library where each product has a definitive "hero" image that serves as the source of truth. When AI generates creative variations later, these hero images anchor the generation — ensuring the product looks exactly right, no hallucinations, no distortions.

Each brand gets its own asset bank. Within that, products have one hero image (THE reference) with optional supporting angles/variants. The system knows which image is the ground truth for each product.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Product fidelity** - Generated assets must look exactly like the real product — the whole point is preventing AI hallucinations
- **Easy upload workflow** - Getting images into the system should be frictionless and fast
- **Clear organization** - Finding and managing product images across brands should be intuitive

All three are equally important for this phase to succeed.

## What's Out of Scope

- AI generation happens in Phase 4 — this phase is building the reference library
- Scope kept open for now; will be refined during planning

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Visual grid gallery — see all product images at a glance, like a photo library
- Big thumbnails, minimal chrome
- Hero image + variants grouped per product
- Visual-first design (consistent with Phase 2 brand swatches approach)

</specifics>

## Additional Context

This phase feeds directly into the Nano Banana asset factory (Phase 4). The reference images become the few-shot context that keeps AI-generated creatives grounded in reality. Getting this right is foundational to the whole "500+ variations without hallucinations" value prop.
