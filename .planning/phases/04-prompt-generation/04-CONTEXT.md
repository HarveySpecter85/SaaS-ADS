# Phase 4: Prompt Generation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-13
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A campaign template system where you pick a goal (drive traffic, generate leads, boost sales) and get a complete creative set tailored to it. The system generates goal-based bundles — pick your objective and receive a full package of prompt variations designed to achieve that outcome.

The flow includes a preview step before full generation — see sample prompts to verify they're on track before committing to the full batch of 50+ variations. This prevents wasted generation cycles and lets you course-correct early.

## What Must Be Nailed

All three are equally critical for this phase to succeed:

- **Volume with variety** — Generate 50+ genuinely different creatives, not just minor text swaps
- **Brand consistency** — Every generated creative feels on-brand (uses correct colors, tone, follows guidelines from Phase 2)
- **Product fidelity** — The product always looks exactly right — no hallucinations, distortions, or wrong details (anchored by Phase 3 hero images)

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

Scope kept open for now; will be refined during planning.

## Specific Ideas

- Preview before generation — see sample prompts before committing to full batch
- Goal-based templates: awareness, lead gen, conversion campaigns
- Prompt variations should pull from brand guidelines (colors, fonts, tone) and product images (hero + variants)
- 50+ variations per generation batch

## Additional Context

This phase is the core of the "Nano Banana asset factory" from the original vision — generating hundreds of creative variations without manual work. The prompts generated here will feed into actual image generation (likely Phase 5) using the product anchors established in Phase 3.

The combination of brand guidelines (Phase 2) + product hero images (Phase 3) + goal-based prompt templates (this phase) creates the few-shot context that prevents AI hallucinations and keeps all generated assets brand-consistent.
